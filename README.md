# Keygen
Simple keygen about 180 lines of code written in python just run `chmod a+x 1337Keys` than you can run it with help `./1337Keys --help` to get the help page, it can convert hex to decimal so you don't have to, just reverse your binary find the hex that it cmp to and for example you could run in console `./1337Keys normal 0x590` and it would generate a key.


ps. To use the name mode the format is as follows `./1337Keys name Jonathan 0x394`
